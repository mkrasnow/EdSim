<p><b>Infanticide Overview</b></p>

<p>It is a common misconception that genes are selected for the good of the species. If a gene has higher fitness than its alternatives, it will spread even if the consequences are bad for the species as a whole. This is why we sometimes see adaptations which are harmful to a species in general and yet become common and species-typical. Take the case of selective infanticide, which is often observed in polygynous species in which groups of females tend to stay together in a "harem" whose reproduction is dominated by a single alpha male until his position is taken over by a new alpha male. This is the case for langur monkeys, which typically live in groups of about 20 individuals, including several adult females, their dependent offspring, and the alpha male. On average, there is a new alpha male every 27 months: a very short window of opportunity for the male to produce all of the offspring he will ever have. This opportunity can be seriously diminished if any of the females are currently infertile because they are pregnant with or nursing the previous alpha's child. (Together, gestation and lactation cause a female to be infertile for up to 30 months, which is potentially the entire duration of a particular alpha's tenure.) Upon gaining control of a troop, therefore, new alphas often kill all of the nursing infants in the troop, bringing the previously nursing females back to fertile status sooner. He continues to kill newborns that are born until a sufficient amount of time has passed such that new newborns are likely to be his own offspring. This behavior is not good for the group or species as it severely hampers the reproductive output of the harem, but it has emerged as a species-typical behavior because males who possess genes which cause this behavior are more successful than males who do not. Imagine what would happen to the genes of a mutant male who did not commit infanticide: he would have far fewer offspring than other males, and his sons who inherited this trait would also have relatively few offspring, and so on until the behavior disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>This simulation will allow you to examine how certain factors affect the evolution of infanticide in a harem species. Simulations include up to 3 different possible types of alpha males: those who do not commit infanticide; those who commit infanticide only against infants nursing when first take over; and those who commit infanticide against infants nursing when first take over plus those not yet born but conceived by previous male. By default, these initially occur at roughly equal probabilities (each making up approximately 1/3 of the population), but you can change these proportions or even make it so that certain strategies are excluded from the population. Once the simulation begins, these proportions will change over time depending on how successful each strategy is. You can control the number of months for which females gestate and nurse their young, as well as the average tenure of alpha males, and the amount of time that the simulation will run. As the simulation runs, alpha males impregnate fertile females, who gestate and nurse their young for the determined durations. After nursing ends, the male young leave and become bachelors (potential alphas for other groups), and the female young stay and become adult females in the same group. When a new male arrives, he either kills infants who are currently nursing, kills infants who are currently nursing and future infants who were fathered by the previous alpha, or does not kill any infants, depending on his genetic strategy. In this simulation, a male's strategy is inherited from his father, but mutations occur at a rate which you can change. This means that even if the proportion of individuals of a particular category is 0, it can still appear by random chance. (HOWEVER, if the starting proportion for a particular category is 0 and the adjacent box is unchecked, then that category will NOT appear at all.) </p>

<p>Once all of the variables are set as you want them, you can decide what speed you want the simulation to run and then hit "GO!". The dots on the left-hand side represent males in the population (current alphas and potential future alphas); the color indicates the category of that male, and the dots will update every month to represent when males die and when new males are born. You will be able to see how the overall size and the composition of the population changes over time. The scatterplot on the upper right-hand side will keep track of these changes over time. The bar graphs on the bottom right-hand side show the average number of offspring that alphas of each strategy produce, as well as the average number of offspring (including those sired by other males) that their groups produce.</p>

<p><b>Suggested variable settings:</b> Try starting out with a population of males who are mostly non-infanticidal (set 'not infanticidal' to 0.8 and the others to 0.1 each) and see what happens. (You may need to increase the number of months and/or the mutation rate.) Then try starting with a population of males who are mostly infanticidal. Which type of strategy has an easier time invading the other? Consider how the variables of gestation length, nursing length, and average tenure should affect the simulation, and then try manipulating them. And remember that random chance matters, too, so run it several times with the same variable settings to see how it changes over runs and what is the most common outcome.</p>
