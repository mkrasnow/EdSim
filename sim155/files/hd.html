<p><b>Hawk/Dove Overview</b></p>

<p>Natural selection will always select for attributes which tend to improve the fitness of those who possess them. Often, this means that attributes which are beneficial will spread in a population until they reach fixation and become species-typical. Sometimes, however, the fitness of a particular attribute depends upon its frequency in the population. For example, a particular attribute might have higher than average fitness when it is rare, and less than average fitness when it is common. This is known as frequency-dependent selection. </p>

<p>For example, consider different strategies for resolving conflicts over resources. Fighting over a resource is costly. If two individuals both want a particular resource and one of them is willing to fight but the other is not, then the one who is willing to fight will take the resource. However, if both are willing to fight, then the individuals will engage in a fight; the winner may be better off for winning the resource, but the loser is likely worse off because of the cost of the fight. Therefore, the willingness to fight will be very beneficial when other individuals are unwilling to fight, will be less beneficial or overall costly when other individuals are willing to fight. </p>

<p>This simulation will allow you to examine how different factors affect the evolution of costly aggression to resolve conflicts over resources and to learn about frequency-dependent selection. In each generation of this simulation, each agent is paired with another agent in a contest over a resource. There are two possible strategies: those who always fight for a resource (called 'Hawks'), and those who never fight for a resource (called 'Doves'). When a Hawk faces a Dove, the Hawk always gets the benefit of the resource (b) while the Dove gets nothing. When a Hawk faces another Hawk, they fight. The winner receives the benefit of the resource (b). The loser pays the cost of the fight (c). The winner is chosen randomly, so the expected payoff to each individual is: (b-c)/2. When a Dove faces another Dove, they randomly decide who gets the benefit of the resource (b) without fighting, so the expected payoff to each agent in this case is: b/2. </p>

<p>Fitness in this simulation is frequency dependent whenever 0 < b < c. If so, then when Hawks are common, Hawks will generally meet other Hawks and earn (b-c)/2, a negative number. Doves will also generally meet Hawks and earn 0, which is greater than (b-c)/2. Therefore, when Hawks are common, it is better to be a Dove than a Hawk, and Doves will increase in frequency. However, when Doves are common, Doves will generally meet Doves and earn b/2. Hawks will also generally meet Doves and earn b, which is more than b/2. Therefore, when Doves are common, it is better to be a Hawk than a Dove, and Hawks will increase in frequency. These forces work in opposite directions, and so the population will generally stabilize around a mixed proportion of Hawks and Doves (known as a mixed or internal equilibrium). The exact proportions will be dictated by the levels of b and c, with the equilibrium proportion of Hawks expected (through mathematic derivation) to be: b/c.</p>

<p>To explore this, you can change the size of b and c. You can also change the size of the population and the number of generations the simulation will last. The first generation will always start with a 50%-50% mix of Hawks and Doves. Mutation will occur at a constant rate of 5% to prevent drift taking the population to fixation merely by chance. Once all of the variables are set as you want them, you can decide what speed you want the simulation to run and then hit "GO!". The dots on the left-hand side represent individuals in the population; the color indicates the category of that individual, and it will update in every generation. You can watch as particular categories increase and decrease in the population. The scatterplot on the upper right-hand side will keep track of these changes over time. </p>

<p><b>Suggested variable settings:</b> What would you expect to happen when the cost of fighting is very high compared to benefit? What would you expect to happen when the cost of fighting is only marginally higher than the benefit? Try these out and test your expectations. Also, notice the effect of changing population size. In smaller populations, drift can have a larger effect and so the back-and-forth swing around the internal equilibrium should be large compared to the case of larger populations. Try it out.</p>
