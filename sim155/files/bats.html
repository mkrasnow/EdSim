<p><b>Vampire Bats Overview</b></p>
<p>Natural selection will always select for attributes which tend to improve the fitness of those who possess them. How, then, can altruistic behaviors (which, by definition, benefit another individual at one's own expense) ever evolve? In cases where there is a chance of reciprocation, altruistic behaviors can serve as an investment in one's own future. In this case, altruistic acts would be a gamble: they may not pay off if the individual who receives aid refuses or is unable to help in the future. This gamble may be worth the risk when the cost of providing aid is sufficiently low, when the benefit of receiving reciprocation is sufficiently high, and when the chance of receiving reciprocation is sufficiently high. </p>

<p>The ecology of vampire bats allows us to examine how these variables can enable the evolution of reciprocation. Vampire bats feed exclusively on blood, hunting at night and preying typically on domesticated livestock. Their hunting trips are not always successful, and they starve to death if they go without food for 60 hours. Without intervention, therefore, 2-3 consecutive nights of bad luck is enough to kill a vampire bat. She can live another day, however, if she can find a successful friend to share her meal. While it would be a cost for the friend to give up part of her own meal, this act of altruism can pay off in the long-term if she can expect reciprocity sometime in the future when she has a bad day. Female vampire bats roost together in groups of about 12, composed of related and non-related bats, who stay together for most of their lives (which can be as long as 18 years). When one member has an unsuccessful night, she returns to her roost and solicits food by licking a roostmate under her wing and on the lips. If the roostmate has found food and is willing to share, she will regurgitate part of her meal into the unsuccessful bat's mouth. Vampire bats do not share with just anyone; they share with kin and with "buddies" with whom they have a long-standing relationship.</p>

<p>This simulation will allow you to examine how different factors effect whether or not reciprocity will evolve in a population. Simulations include up to 3 different possible types of individuals: individuals who always cooperate when help is solicited ('ALLC'), individuals who always defect when help is solicited ('ALLD'), and individuals who cooperate with all individuals except those who have previously refused to help (tit for tat / 'TFT'). By default, these initially occur at roughly equal probabilities (each making up approximately 1/3 of the population), but you can change these proportions or even make it so that certain strategies are excluded from the population. Once the simulation begins, these proportions will change over time depending on how successful each strategy is. You can control the proportion of hunting trips which are successful, as well as how much it costs to give help and how large of a benefit one gets from receiving help. You can also change the size of the population and the number of days for which the simulation will run. </p>

<p>Once all of the variables are set as you want them, you can decide what speed you want the simulation to run and then hit "GO!". On each new day, individuals will all go hunting. Unsuccessful individuals will solicit help from successful ones. When asked for help, individuals will respond according to their strategy ('ALLC', 'ALLD', or 'TFT'). If a request is denied, the individual will ask other individuals until she receives help or runs out of potential helpers. Individuals who have not secured the minimum necessary food (either through a successful hunting trip or through solicitation from a successful individual) will die and be replaced by a new individual. New individuals will tend to have whatever strategy or strategies are currently the most successful, but mutations are possible, meaning that even if the proportion of individuals of a particular category is 0, it can still appear by random chance. (HOWEVER, if the starting proportion for a particular category is 0 and the adjacent box is unchecked, then that category will NOT appear at all.) The dots on the left-hand side represent individuals in the population; the color indicates the category of that individual, and it will update as individuals die and are replaced from day to day. You can watch as particular categories increase and decrease in the population. The scatterplot on the upper right-hand side will keep track of these changes over time. The bar graphs on the bottom right-hand side show the average life expectancy of individuals within each category and the percent of solicitations made by members of each category which result in them receiving assistance.</p>

<p><b>Suggested variable settings:</b> What happens when you change the average success of hunting trips and the costs and benefits of food-sharing? How does this change the evolvability of reciprocation? Try experimenting with different combinations of strategies. What happens when individuals who always defect enter a population of cooperators (ALLD=0, checked; TFT=0,unchecked, ALLC=1, checked)? Can defectors take over the population? (And what does this do to the overall mortality of the population?) Try the same thing with other combinations, too. And remember that random chance matters, too, so run it several times with the same variable settings to see how it changes over runs and what is the most common outcome. Consider the implications of reciprocity in vampire bats. If there was no reciprocity, what would this mean for the mortality of particular bats? What happens if there are cheater bats who solicit help, and then later defect on their helpers? (Keep in mind that bats can live for 18 years and have a memory for past interactions with particular individuals… If a particular bat occasionally gets suckered into helping a cheater but usually has successful interactions, is she better or worse off for sharing? If a cheater bat solicits help and then cheats, what are the implications for her future? Which bat is better off, and are there any circumstances that would change your answer?)</p>
