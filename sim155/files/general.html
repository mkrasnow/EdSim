<p>This program includes 4 different simulations (Vampire Bats, Incest Avoidance, Infanticide, and Hawk/Dove) which you can use to explore how particular variables will affect the evolvability of different traits in different ecological contexts. </p>

<p>For each simulation, there are different types of individuals who behave differently depending on a genetic variant that is inherited from parent to child. The different types of individuals will initially exist in particular proportions in the population, but these proportions will change over time depending on their reproductive success. By default, the types will initially exist at roughly equal proportions in the population, but you will be able to change these starting proportions. Even if you set a particular type to 0 (or if it falls to 0 during the simulation), it will still be able to mutate into the population by random chance. (However, if you want to see what happens when one or more types are not able to exist at all, you can set the type(s) to 0 and uncheck the adjacent box(es).) </p>

<p>You will also be able to control other variables for each simulation. For all simulations, you will be able to control how long they will run (how many days / months / generations). There are also several other variables that are specific to each simulation which you will be able to manipulate. By systematically varying these, you will be able to see how each variable affects the evolvability of the different types of individuals. Each simulation has accompanying text which describes the simulation and the controllable variables and includes suggestions for particular settings to test the importance of different variables.</p>

<p>When you select a particular simulation from the drop&ndash;down menu, the variables which you are able to manipulate will appear in the gray space above, and a description of that simulation will appear in the main box. It will include background information which will help you understand the context of that simulation and will also describe the particular variables which you can manipulate. Additionally, suggestions will be made about how to set the variables in order to test particularly interesting circumstances. We recommend that you explore different combinations; think first about what you expect to happen, and then run the simulation. Remember that random chance can determine whether or not certain things ever have a chance to evolve, so you may want to run the simulation multiple times with the same settings to identify how they vary over runs and to detect any kind of pattern. </p>

<p>Once you have the variables set as you want them and hit "GO!", the text in the main box will be taken over with a visual representation of the progress of the simulation. (However, you can view the text in a separate window while running the simulation by clicking "sim text". It may be helpful to have the text available while you run the simulation!) On the left, there will be dots. Each will represent one individual in the simulation. The color of the dot will indicate the individual's type. The dots will update over time to indicate how the composition of the population changes over time, based on the success of individuals of different types, as well as some random chance. For three of the simulations (Hawk/Dove, Vampire Bats and Incest Avoidance), there will be a fixed population size for the entire duration of a simulation but the proportions of individuals with particular strategies will change. For the other (Infanticide), the proportions and the overall size of the population will change over time. In addition to the dots which represent individuals in the simulation, there will be graphs on the right&ndash;hand side. The top graph will always track changing proportions of types over time. The bottom graphs will give some other description that is specific to that simulation (which is explained in the text for that simulation). </p>
