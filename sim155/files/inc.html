<p><b>Incest Avoidance Overview</b></p>

<p>It is very common for genetic mutations to produce nonfunctional recessives (i.e., the gene no longer codes for a functional protein). As long as this recessive is matched with a healthy dominant, the individual who bears it is fine. If an individual has two copies of the same recessive, however, it will be expressed, which will harm (possibly kill) the individual. As long as two parents are unrelated, then the probability that they will both have the same deleterious recessive (and will, therefore, be able to pass it on to their offspring) is determined by the rate at which the recessive occurs in the population as a whole. If the recessive is rare, this will be a very low probability. If the two parents are close relatives, however, then they may have inherited the same deleterious recessive from a common ancestor; therefore, the risk is much higher. The closer the relation, the higher the risk. If relatedness is not considered as a factor when evaluating potential mates, individuals may sometimes mate with close relatives &mdash; especially if relatives tend to stay in close proximity with one another or if there are relatively few alternative options. On the other hand, there is a potential cost of choosiness: individuals who refuse to mate with their relatives may run out of options &mdash; especially when there are relatively few potential mates who are non-relatives.</p>

<p>This simulation will allow you to examine the relative costs (c) and benefits (b) of incest avoidance. Simulations include up to 4 different possible types of individuals: individuals who ignore relatedness in choosing a mate; individuals who avoid mating with siblings (r = 0.5); individuals who avoid mating with first cousins (r = 0.125) and closer; and individuals who avoid mating with second cousins (r = 0.03125) and closer. By default, these types initially occur at equal probabilities (each making up a quarter of the population), but you can change these proportions or even make it so that certain types are excluded from the population. You can also change the size of the population and the number of generations. In each new generation, the proportion of individuals falling into each category will be determined by the success of that strategy in the previous generation. Additionally, mutations occur at a rate which you can change. This means that even if the proportion of individuals of a particular category is 0, it can still appear by random chance. (HOWEVER, if the starting proportion for a particular category is 0 and the adjacent box is unchecked, then that category will NOT appear at all.) Finally, you can change the number of lethal equivalents which individuals in the population possess. </p>

<p>Once all of the variables are set as you want them, you can decide what speed you want the simulation to run and then hit "GO!". The dots on the left-hand side represent individuals in the population; the color indicates the category of that individual, and it will update in every generation. You can watch as particular categories increase and decrease in the population. The scatterplot on the upper right-hand side will keep track of these changes over time. The bar graphs on the bottom right-hand side show the percent of offspring produced by individuals of each type who were not viable and the percent of individuals of each category who never were able to mate.</p>

<p><b>Suggested variable settings:</b> The negative consequences of incest are greatest when individuals tend to have a large number of deleterious recessives. See what happens when you change the number of lethal equivalents. Also, check out what happens when 1 strategy starts out as dominant and see which other strategies are able to invade! You can make more precise inferences if you restrict it so that only 2 or 3 strategies exist (by unchecking &amp; setting the other(s) to 0). Remember, random chance matters, too, so run it several times with the same variable settings to see how it changes over runs and what is the most common outcome.</p>
