<p><b>Simulation</b> &mdash; A computer model of a population of organisms in an environment over time. The simulated genes of the organisms are exposed to mutation and natural selection, which allows you to observe evolution in action.</p>

<p><b>Adaptations</b> &mdash; Complex traits which have been selected because they promote their own reproduction</p>

<p><b>Alpha male</b> &mdash; [Inf] a male who is dominant over other males; he may enjoy exclusive mating with the females in his troop, as in the infanticide simulation</p>

<p><b>Internal equilibrium / Mixed equilibrium</b> &mdash; [HD] a particular equilibrium which requires a particular mixture of behavioral strategies</p>

<p><b>Mixed equilibrium</b><i> (see Internal equilibrium)</i></p>

<p><b>Mutation</b> &mdash; A change that occurs by chance in a particular gene when being passed from parent to child. In these simulations, mutations can only occur to the specified alternate gene(s).</p>

<p><b>Mutation rate</b> &mdash; The proportion of genes that mutate during reproduction</p>

<p><b>Natural selection / Selection</b> &mdash; The principle that a gene (and any resulting attribute(s)) which promotes its own reproduction will tend to spread in a population</p>
